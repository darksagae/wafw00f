# wafw00f
The WAFW00F tool is a powerful utility included in Kali Linux that is used for identifying and fingerprinting Web Application Firewalls (WAFs). It operates by sending HTTP requests to a target website and analyzing the responses to determine if a WAF is present and, if so, which type it is.

### How to Use WAFW00F

1. **Installation**: If you're using Kali Linux, WAFW00F is typically pre-installed. If not, you can install it using the following command:
   ```
   sudo apt install wafw00f
   ```

2. **Basic Command Structure**: The basic command to use WAFW00F is:
   ```
   wafw00f [options] <url>
   ```
   For example:
   ```
   wafw00f http://www.victim.org/
   ```

3. **Common Options**:
   - `-h`, `--help`: Show help message.
   - `-v`, `--verbose`: Enable verbose output.
   - `-a`, `--findall`: Find all matching WAFs without stopping at the first match.
   - `-r`, `--noredirect`: Do not follow HTTP redirections.
   - `-o OUTPUT`: Write output to a specified file format (CSV, JSON, or text).
   - `-l`, `--list`: List all detectable WAFs.

### Examples of Usage

- **Basic WAF Detection**:
   To check if a WAF is present on a website, you can run:
   ```
   wafw00f www.amazon.com
   ```
   This command will return information about the WAF protecting the site, if any is detected [[2]](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/identification-of-web-application-firewall-using-wafw00f-in-kali-linux/).

- **Finding All WAFs**:
   To find all WAFs that match the signatures, use:
   ```
   wafw00f -a www.amazon.com
   ```
   This will provide a comprehensive list of WAFs that are detected [[2]](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/identification-of-web-application-firewall-using-wafw00f-in-kali-linux/).

- **Using with Nmap**:
   You can also integrate WAFW00F with Nmap for enhanced scanning. For example:
   ```
   nmap -p 80,443 --script=http-waf-detect equifaxsecurity2017.com
   ```
   This command will scan the specified ports and detect any WAFs in place [[2]](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/identification-of-web-application-firewall-using-wafw00f-in-kali-linux/).

- **Custom Headers**:
   If you need to pass custom headers, you can do so with:
   ```
   wafw00f --headers=myheaders.txt http://www.example.com
   ```
   This allows you to modify the requests sent to the server [[1]](https://www.kali.org/tools/wafw00f/).

### Conclusion

WAFW00F is a versatile tool for security researchers and penetration testers, enabling them to identify and analyze the WAFs protecting web applications. By understanding how to use its various options and commands, users can effectively gather information about the security measures in place on target websites.
